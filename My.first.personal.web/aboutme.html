    <p class="apresentacao__conteudo__texto"> My name is Rafael Henrique Pires de Sousa, born on 24/10/2003, in Belo Horizonte - Minas Gerais</p>
    <p class="apresentacao__conteudo__texto"> <b>Since</b> I was young, I've always had a fascination for technology, computers, consoles and electronic devices. Since I was young, my father encouraged me to learn and work with computers more focused on the hardware part of the computers, but unfortunately I never had so much attachment to the physical part of computers, but to the software part, but for many years I did not invest in that area, I worked in other areas completely different from the IT area, I did other studies, until about a year ago I tried to study C# for the first time, but I wasn't very successful, until I recently made a decision to dedicate myself to the area once and for all in the area of programming, and in the area of Web Development, I started studying HTML5 and CSS3, I will soon learn JavaScript and Python, I hope to be successful in my studies and to be one of the best professionals in the area of IT.</p>
